Choosing the right programming language to learn can shape your career opportunities.  
Here are the **top 5 languages to learn in 2025**, with explanations and code examples.

---

## 1. Python

**Why**: Python dominates data science, machine learning, automation, and backend frameworks like Django and FastAPI. Itâ€™s beginner-friendly and has a massive ecosystem.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

## 2. JavaScript / TypeScript

**Why**: JavaScript runs everywhere â€” browsers, servers (Node.js), mobile apps, and desktop apps. TypeScript adds static typing for safer, large-scale projects.

**JavaScript Example:**

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

**TypeScript Example:**

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

---

## 3. Rust

**Why**: Rust is loved for memory safety and performance. Itâ€™s widely adopted in system programming, blockchain, embedded systems, and WebAssembly.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

---

## 4. Go (Golang)

**Why**: Go is simple, fast, and designed for concurrency. Itâ€™s popular for backend systems, microservices, and cloud infrastructure.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

---

## 5. C\#

**Why**: C# powers enterprise applications, Unity game development, and cross-platform apps with .NET MAUI. With Microsoftâ€™s backing, it remains a solid, in-demand choice.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
