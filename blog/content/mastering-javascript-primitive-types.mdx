JavaScript has seven **primitive types**. They form the foundation of the language and behave differently from objects. Understanding them deeply will save you from many bugs and help you write clearer, safer code.

---

## The Seven Primitive Types

- **string**
- **number**
- **bigint**
- **boolean**
- **undefined**
- **symbol**
- **null**

Each of these is immutable and stored by value. That means when you assign a primitive, you get a fresh copy of the value, not a shared reference.

```js
let a = "hello";
let b = a;
a = "world";

console.log(a); // "world"
console.log(b); // "hello" — b still has its own copy
```

---

## Strings

Strings represent text. They’re sequences of UTF‑16 code units.

```js
const msg = "JavaScript";
console.log(msg.length); // 10
console.log(msg.toUpperCase()); // "JAVASCRIPT"
```

Even though you can call methods like `.toUpperCase()`, strings are **not objects**. Behind the scenes, JavaScript temporarily wraps them in a `String` object (this is called *auto‑boxing*).

```js
let str = "abc";
str.hello = "world";
console.log(str.hello); // undefined — primitives can’t hold properties
```

---

## Numbers

JavaScript numbers are **IEEE‑754 double‑precision floats**. That means:
- Integers and decimals share the same type.
- Precision is limited to 53 bits.

```js
console.log(42);        // integer
console.log(3.14);      // float
console.log(1 / 0);     // Infinity
console.log(-1 / 0);    // -Infinity
console.log(NaN);       // Not-a-Number
```

### Quirk: Floating‑point Math

```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); // false
```

This happens because some decimals cannot be represented exactly in binary.

---

## BigInt

`BigInt` handles integers larger than what `number` can safely represent.

```js
const big = 9007199254740991n; // largest safe integer + 1
console.log(big + 2n); // 9007199254740993n
```

You can’t mix `BigInt` and `number` directly:

```js
console.log(1n + 1); // TypeError
```

---

## Booleans

`true` and `false` are the only boolean values. They often appear as results of comparisons or logical expressions.

```js
console.log(5 > 3); // true
console.log(Boolean("")); // false
console.log(Boolean("js")); // true
```

---

## Undefined

`undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned.

```js
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined
```

You’ll also see it as the default return value of functions that don’t explicitly return something.

---

## Null

`null` represents the intentional absence of any value.

```js
let user = null; // user is intentionally set to nothing
```

Quirk:

```js
console.log(typeof null); // "object" (a historical bug in JavaScript)
```

---

## Symbols

Symbols are unique and immutable identifiers, often used as object property keys.

```js
const id1 = Symbol("id");
const id2 = Symbol("id");

console.log(id1 === id2); // false
```

They’re useful when you need keys that won’t accidentally clash.

---

## Primitive vs. Object

| Feature          | Primitive          | Object         |
|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Mutability       | Immutable          | Usually mutable|
| Equality         | Compared by value  | Compared by reference|
| Memory           | Stored directly    | Stored by reference|

Example:

```js
let obj1 = { a: 1 };
let obj2 = { a: 1 };

console.log(obj1 === obj2); // false — different references
console.log(5 === 5);       // true — primitive values compared directly
```

---

## Gotchas to Watch Out For

- `typeof null === "object"` (long‑standing bug).
- Wrappers like `new String("hi")` create objects, not primitives.
- Numbers can overflow silently: `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` is 2^53 − 1.
- Mixing `BigInt` and `number` throws an error.
- Strings are immutable — methods return new strings instead of changing the original.

---

## Best Practices

- Prefer primitives for simple data.
- Use `const` where possible — makes intent clear.
- Don’t use wrapper constructors (`new String`, `new Boolean`, `new Number`).
- Reach for `BigInt` when precision beyond 53 bits is necessary.
- Be explicit about `null` vs. `undefined`. Use `null` to signal “intentional empty,” leave `undefined` for “not assigned.”

---

## Practice Questions

1. Why is `typeof null === "object"`?
2. What’s the difference between `==` and `===` when comparing primitives?
3. Why does `0.1 + 0.2` not equal `0.3`?
4. How are `string` methods like `.toUpperCase()` possible if strings aren’t objects?
5. When would you choose `BigInt` over `number`?

---

## Summary

JavaScript’s primitives are simple but packed with quirks. Mastering them helps you:
- Avoid hidden bugs
- Write cleaner logic
- Understand how values flow through your program

Once you have a solid handle on primitives, concepts like type coercion, equality, and memory management become much easier.
