JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**, which means you don’t declare variable types up front. However, JavaScript (and tools built on top of it, like TypeScript) often demonstrate different *typing approaches*.  
In this article, we’ll break down **Implicit, Explicit, Nominal, Structural, and Duck Typing**, with clear explanations and code examples.

---

## Implicit Typing

**Implicit typing** happens when the type of a value is inferred by the language at runtime.  
In JavaScript, this means variables take on the type of whatever value they’re assigned.

```js
let name = "Hussein"; // implicitly a string
let count = 42;       // implicitly a number
````

Here, we never declared `name` as a string or `count` as a number, but JavaScript knows based on the values.

💡 **Takeaway**: Implicit typing makes code shorter and flexible but can cause confusion when values change unexpectedly.

---

## Explicit Typing

**Explicit typing** is when the developer defines the type directly.
JavaScript itself doesn’t support this natively, but TypeScript (a superset of JS) does.

```ts
let age: number = 30;
let username: string = "Al-Hussein";
```

In plain JavaScript, you often mimic explicit typing through **runtime checks**:

```js
function greet(name) {
  if (typeof name !== "string") {
    throw new Error("Name must be a string");
  }
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}

greet("Hussein"); // works
greet(123);       // throws error
```

💡 **Takeaway**: Explicit typing improves safety and readability, especially in large codebases.

---

## Nominal Typing

**Nominal typing** means types are distinct by their names, not just their shape.
JavaScript doesn’t natively use nominal typing, but TypeScript can simulate it using `brand` patterns.

```ts
type USD = number & { readonly brand: unique symbol };
type EUR = number & { readonly brand: unique symbol };

function payInUSD(amount: USD) { /* ... */ }

let dollars = 100 as USD;
let euros = 100 as EUR;

payInUSD(dollars); // ✅ works
payInUSD(euros);   // ❌ error: type mismatch
```

💡 **Takeaway**: Nominal typing is useful for domain-specific rules, like distinguishing currencies.

---

## Structural Typing

**Structural typing** says that two types are compatible if their **shapes** (properties and methods) match, regardless of their names.
This is the default model in TypeScript.

```ts
type Point = { x: number; y: number };
type Coordinate = { x: number; y: number };

let p: Point = { x: 1, y: 2 };
let c: Coordinate = p; // ✅ works (same structure)
```

In plain JavaScript, object shapes matter more than their labels:

```js
function logPoint(point) {
  console.log(`x: ${point.x}, y: ${point.y}`);
}

const coord = { x: 10, y: 20 };
logPoint(coord); // ✅ works because it has x and y
```

💡 **Takeaway**: Structural typing is flexible, but can sometimes allow unintended matches.

---

## Duck Typing

**Duck typing** is a form of structural typing in dynamic languages like JavaScript.
The idea: *“If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.”*

```js
function quack(duck) {
  if (typeof duck.quack === "function") {
    duck.quack();
  } else {
    console.log("Not a duck!");
  }
}

const realDuck = { quack: () => console.log("Quack!") };
const person = { quack: () => console.log("I can quack too!") };

quack(realDuck); // Quack!
quack(person);   // I can quack too!
```

Here, both objects are treated as “ducks” because they have a `quack` method.

💡 **Takeaway**: Duck typing is very common in JavaScript, but it can lead to subtle bugs if two different objects just happen to have the same property names.

---

## Final Thoughts

* **Implicit typing** → JS infers types for you.
* **Explicit typing** → You define types (often in TS or via runtime checks).
* **Nominal typing** → Types are distinct by name.
* **Structural typing** → Types are compatible if they share structure.
* **Duck typing** → Objects are judged by behavior, not inheritance.

Understanding these helps you reason about **JavaScript’s dynamic nature** and also bridges the gap to **TypeScript’s type system**.
